* Move checking for arguments not input by user into dispRule().
  Two birds, one stone -- allows dispRule to handle invalid input as well as cleans up main().

* Look into even-/odd-ness of initial array.
  Potential problem case: if dispWidth is even or odd, my affect finding center of initial array.
